# Deep_Learning_MAY_25
🚀 From MNIST to Transformers – My Deep Learning Journey (with Code + Demos)
What started with basic digit classification turned into a deep dive through CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, attention mechanisms, transformers, and GANs.

I’ve built and open-sourced every project — not just to showcase, but to give back and maybe guide someone who's just starting out.

🧠 The Journey So Far (All Code Public):
📦 Full Repo: Deep_Learning_MAY_25

✅ CNNs
• 90% accuracy on CIFAR100 → CNN Code
• Learned residual connections → ResNet-style

🔁 RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs
• Built sin wave predictors, next-word models, sentence generators, and a quirky story writer
 → Sentence Generator
 → Story Generator

🌍 Language Translation (Seq2Seq & Transformers)
• 🇫🇷 French → English → With Attention (Great results)
• 🇩🇪 English → German → Transformer From Scratch

🎨 GANs: Generate Images
• MNIST → Code
• Human faces (DCGAN) → Try it

⚡ Try These Yourself:
🔤 Translate text using Transformer
 → Run this notebook

🧠 Generate sentences/stories
 → Sentence script
 → Story writer

🧬 Generate faces using GAN
 → Run DCGAN

🫂 Faces
🙏 Why I’m Sharing This:
I’m not doing this to show off models — I’m hoping this post reaches someone who's just starting out, feeling lost like I once was.

This repo is for you — clone it, run it, tweak it, break it, fix it, and learn from it.

🤝 If you’re walking this path too — let’s connect. If you ever need help, I promise to give it my best — to the maximum of what I know and can guide you through.

Let’s keep building together 🚀
